            <p>Also, to flawlessly attain precision during diamond grading, a gem lab needs to be able to adopt an organized and productive work process. Organization and productivity happen to be crucial parts of the LDG diamond grading process.</p>
            <p>After the inspection and grading of every caliber of diamond and jewelry, we summarize each process in distinguished reports, known as certificates.</p>  
            <p>The LDG diamond certification is a summary of the detailed grading we carry out on your precious stones. This certificate contains the various characteristics of the stone as ascertained during the grading process.
                At LDG, we save the certificate of every graded stone for future use. We also make them accessible online so that your schedules are not disrupted.</p>
